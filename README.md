README

This is a React Native component for a product details screen. Here's an assessment of the project structure, dependencies, and configuration based on the code:

Project Structure:
- The code consists of a single component named `ProductDetailsScreen`.
- The component is defined as a functional component using the arrow function syntax.
- The component renders a scrollable view (`ScrollView`) that contains various elements representing the product details screen.
- The styling for the component is defined using the `StyleSheet.create` method, which creates a stylesheet containing multiple style objects.

Dependencies:
- The code imports several components from the `react-native` library, including `View`, `Text`, `Button`, `TouchableHighlight`, `StyleSheet`, and `ScrollView`.
- The code also imports specific icons from the `@expo/vector-icons` package, including `MaterialIcons`, `MaterialCommunityIcons`, and `Ionicons`.
- Additionally, the code imports the `Image` component from `react-native` and uses it to display an image.

Configuration:
- The code does not show any explicit configuration related to the project itself, such as project-level configuration files or settings.

Best Practices:
- The code uses functional components, which is a recommended approach in React Native.
- The styling is defined using the `StyleSheet.create` method, which optimizes performance by creating a stylesheet object.
- The code follows a modular structure by separating the component's rendering logic from its styles.
